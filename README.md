Why
---
XML is `<verbose></verbose>` due to its closing tags and its lack of a macro
preprocessor. I want an XML preprocessor that is very close to XML (declarative,
structured, light on syntax) but that allows me to describe documents in fewer
characters.

What
----
Llama is a lisp-like data description language, and a compiler for that language
targeting XML, implemented in Javascript.
